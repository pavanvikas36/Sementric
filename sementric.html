                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
                    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
                    Some HTML elements have no content. These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
                </p>
                <h4>Nested HTML Elements</h4>
                <p>HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
                    All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
                    Nested HTML elements refer to placing one HTML element inside another to create a hierarchical structure. This allows for better organization and styling of content. For example, a element might contain multiple (paragraph) or (anchor) elements. The outer element is the parent, while the inner element is the child. 
                    Nesting elements is essential for creating complex layouts and maintaining semantic structure in web pages.
                </p>
                <h4>HTML Tag Reference</h4>
                <p>W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.
                    An HTML tag reference is a comprehensive guide or list of HTML tags and their attributes used in web development. It provides detailed information about each tag's purpose, syntax, and how it affects the structure or presentation of a webpage. These references are crucial for developers to understand the correct usage of tags when writing HTML code. It helps ensure proper formatting, functionality, and accessibility of web content. 
                </p>
                <h4>HTML Headings</h4>
                <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage. Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
                    Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
                </p>
                <h4>HTML Text Formatting</h4>
                <p>HTML text formatting refers to the use of HTML tags to style and modify text content on a webpage.
                     These tags can change the appearance, such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text. Common text formatting tags include for bold, for italics, and for underlining. 
                     HTML also supports text alignment, font size, and color adjustments through various tags and attributes. Proper text formatting helps improve the readability and visual appeal of content on a webpage.

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. 
                    It allows you to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements. CSS enhances the visual presentation of a website and separates content structure from design.
                </p>
                <h4>CSS Comments</h4>
                <p>CSS comments are used to add notes or explanations within the code, making it easier to understand and maintain. They are enclosed by /* at the beginning and */ at the end. Comments are ignored by the browser, meaning they don't affect the rendering of the page. 
                    You can use comments to explain sections of your styles, provide instructions, or temporarily disable parts of the code during development. 
                    This helps improve code readability, especially in collaborative environments.
                </p>
                <h4>CSS Selectors</h4>
                <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to select and target HTML elements that you want to style. 
                    They define which elements on the page the CSS rules should apply to. Common types of selectors include element selectors (targeting HTML tags), class selectors (using a class attribute), and ID selectors (targeting an element with a specific ID).
                     CSS selectors can also be more advanced, like attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements, which provide more specific targeting of elements based on certain conditions.
                </p>
                <h4>CSS Math Functions</h4>
                <p>CSS math functions allow you to perform calculations directly within your CSS styles. These functions are useful for dynamic layout adjustments, such as resizing elements relative to others. 
                    Common math functions in CSS include calc(), min(), max(), and clamp(). For example, calc() allows you to combine units like percentages and pixels to create flexible layouts, while min() and max() let you set values that adjust based on certain constraints. 
                    These functions enhance flexibility and responsiveness in styling.

                <h2>Java Script</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, validate forms, and interact with external data, all in real-time on the client side. 
                    JavaScript is essential for web development, enabling features like animations, user input handling, and AJAX requests. 
                    It runs in the browser, making it a key technology alongside HTML and CSS for modern web applications
                </p>
                <h4>JavaScript Functions and Events</h4>
                <p>A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
                    For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript Functions are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. A function is defined using the function keyword, followed by a name, parameters (optional), and a body containing the code to execute. Functions allow you to organize and modularize your code, making it easier to maintain and reuse.
                    JavaScript Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, mouse movements) or changes in the document. Events are often tied to HTML elements and are handled using event listeners, which respond to specific events and execute the corresponding code.
                </p>
                <h4>JavaScript Output</h4>
                <p>In JavaScript, output refers to displaying or returning data to the user or the console. There are several ways to produce output in JavaScript:
                    <li>Console Output</li>
                    <li>Alert Boxes</li>
                    <li>Document Output (modifying HTML)</li>
                    <li>Return Statement in Functions</li>
                </p>
